## Using Luna402

### Why is there a 50-second cooldown?

The cooldown ensures:

- Fair access for all users
- System stability during high traffic
- Protection against abuse

- Compare different tokens side-by-side

The AI will process all tokens in a single request.

No. Luna402 is completely stateless:

- Conversations are not stored on our servers
- Refresh the page to start a new session
- No data is logged or tracked
- Complete privacy by design

This protects your privacy but means you can't retrieve old conversations.

The AI provides analysis based on:

- Training data from 72,000+ tokens
- Real-time web search data
- Live blockchain information
- Historical patterns and trends
- Multiple data source aggregation

However, crypto markets are highly volatile and unpredictable. Use insights as one data point among many in your research.

### What blockchains does it support?

Luna402 primarily focuses on:

- **Solana** (Pump.fun tokens)
- **Ethereum** tokens
- Other EVM-compatible chains

The AI can analyze any token with publicly available data and contract information.

## Troubleshooting

### The website won't load

Try these solutions:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try a different browser
4. Disable browser extensions
5. Check if your firewall is blocking the site

### The chat interface isn't responding

Common fixes:

1. Refresh the page
2. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
3. Clear browser cookies
4. Try incognito/private mode
5. Update your browser to the latest version

### The AI is taking too long

This is normal if:

- Your query is complex
- Multiple data sources are being queried
- The system is under high load

Wait up to 30 seconds. If longer, refresh and try again.

### I'm getting error messages

If you see errors:

1. Refresh the page and try again

3. Check your internet connection
4. Try again in a few minutes
5. Contact support if persistent

### The cooldown timer isn't working

The 50-second cooldown is enforced:

- Refreshing won't reset it
- Opening new tabs won't bypass it
- It's tracked in your browser's local storage
- Wait for the timer to complete

This is intentional to ensure fair usage.
